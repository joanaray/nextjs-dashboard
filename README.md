## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.

### Upgrades

The tutorial handles invoice data manipulation (create, update, delete) but I implemented that also for customers. So now it's possible to create, delete and update customers (except for photos because I wasn't sure how to handle file upload so I'm just feeding that part from [thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/)).

Anyway, feel free to snoop around.
